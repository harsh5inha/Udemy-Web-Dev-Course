Section 1: Front End Web Development

Watch the videos without taking notes, and then repeat what you learned on your own. That's how you actually
learn. Makes sense.

"You must understand that task-switching is very difficult. It requires a lot of motivation. If as soon as
you get home, you slump on the sofa and switch on the TV, you’ve already lost that evening. This is because
the amount of motivation required to task-switch and do something not driven by evolution like eating or
sleeping is a Herculean task. This is why the moment you enter the door and change to a new environment is
the most crucial moment. If at this moment, you tell yourself that you are just going to do 20 minutes of
coding practice, you will most likely succeed and use your own inertia to end up learning for an hour or
more. No brain will perceive a 20-minute task as a lot of effort and you end up tricking your brain to take
advantage of your evening."

"The skill that most employers look for when recruiting is the ability to think. Knowledge is valued in a
world where information is hard to come by. In the 1800s, only the rich had access to good books and good
teachers. Now, everyone has all the information they had and more at the tap of a mouse. Information is
losing value, the ability to think is the stock to buy.""

"The next thing I’m going to tell you will be controversial. We believe that people don’t value things that
don’t have a value. This is the reason why Coursera is taking down a large number of their free courses.
They saw that millions of people were signing up for it but no one was taking any of the classes let alone
complete any of the projects. It was actually detrimental to students’ learning to offer a free course."
