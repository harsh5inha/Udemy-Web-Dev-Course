HTML elements sometimes require an opening and closing tag. Some, like <br> and
<hr>, are self closing.

HTML tags have elements and attributes. Documentation of the list of elements
and attributes can be found at devdocs.io.


"utf-8" includes all the characters we'd need from Unicode. Even emojis now have
a mapping to a unicode value. The character set is coded in the meta tab in the
heading of your HTML doc. If you use a different set, then the character to
numbermapping will be different and the web page will render in a non-sensical
way.Everything that is unicode, can be encoded correctly using UTF-8. Using
UTF-8gives you the maximum chance that your browser will be rendered correctly
on browsers that are from international visitors.

<meta> tags are useful for meta data about the page. You can include your
keywords, a description that shows just below your site on google, etc.

There's a difference between using <strong> and using <b> even though visually
they might output the same thing (bold). There's also a difference between
using <em> and <i> for emphasis v italics even though visually they might do
the same thing.

The <em> element represents stress emphasis of its contents, while the <i>
element represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such a foreign
word, fictional character thoughts, or when the text refers to the definition
of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning.

The <strong> element is for content that is of greater importance, while the
<b> element is used to draw attention to text without indicating that it's more
important.

In general, we want to use <em> and <strong> for italics and
bold, but adding tags is about the meaning of the content. If you want to bold,
italicizem etc. text simply for decoration, you should instead actually use the
CSS property.

It's better to have all your images etc. locally so that you have fewer
dependencies on external sites. If they go down or change URLs then you won't
have to update the directory addresses for your linked images etc.

<a href = "URL">Name</a> anchor tag for links etc.

You can also create multiple HTML pages for your website and then have them
link to each other by including links.
