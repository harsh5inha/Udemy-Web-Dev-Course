EXPRESS
Express is a Node Framework. Sort of like how jQuery is a framework for vanilla
JavaScript. Express.js helps us use Node.js by helping us not have to write
excessive amounts of code. There are alternatives, but Express is the most
popular.

BUILDING OUR OWN SERVER
To install express we do: `npm install express`. It's a package, just like normal.
And as mentioned, it'll bring along its own dependencies, which in the case of
express, is many.

People often use the moniker "app" to refer to the express module. This is
common procedure, and can be seen in the server.js file -> Practice Site 9 (Server.js)

A "port" is basically a channel that we tune our server to. Kind of similar to
how we tune in to certain radio channels, etc. So if we set up a server to listen
on port 3000, and then type in "localhost:3000" into the search bar, we should
arrive at the server we set up. So our browser is going to try and send a get request
for the website, but obviously there's no functionality, we haven't set that up yet.

Typing in "localhost:3000" in this case brings us to the root, or home page of
our website. Just like Google.com or any other website. It's just that our website's
server is our local computer, make sense?

Okay so, you could set up a basic server to console log the request data from the
request that the browser made and to return to the browser simply the word
"Hello" as follows (the full code is in server.js):

`app.get("/", function(request, response){
  console.log(request);
  response.send("Hello");
})`

Now you could also return HTML:

`app.get("/", function(request, response){
  console.log(request);
  response.send("<h1>Hello, world!</h1>");
})`

or even an entire HTML page:

`app.get("/", function(request, response){
  console.log(request);
  response.sendFile("/Users/hsinha/Desktop/Udemy-Web-Dev-Course/Web Development/Practice Site 10 (Calculator via your own Server)/index.html");
})`

as explained later, this can be simplified to:

`app.get("/", function(request, response){
  console.log(request);
  response.sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html");
})`

Usually you'll see "req" instead of "request" and "res" instead of "response",
as shown in server.js (Site 9) and calculator.js (Site 10).


ROUTES
So we can also specify what should happen upon browser requests to different
routes other than our root page (home page). To test those other routes we can
go to `localhost:3000/route_name`. For example `localhost:3000/about`.


NODEMON
Nodemon is an npm package that makes it easier for us to auto start our servers.
It will monitor for changes in the code, and will automatically restart the
server so we don't have to manually shut it down and start it over again each
time we want to see the updated code on our website. It doesn't matter where you
install it. Just download it in your local root directory and you should be able
to use it in all your projects. To install: `npm install -g nodemon`. Now whenever
you launch your server type `nodemon server.js`, instead of just `node`.

Okay well you can't do that here, because the `-g` flag stands for global, and
we don't have permission to do that on this computer because it's company owned.
So in this case we can download the module locally in our directory without the
`-g` flag, and when we want to launch our server we do: `npx nodemon server.js`.


CALCULATOR WEBSITE SERVER - (Practice Site 10)
We're going to try and build a web server that acts as a calculator.

STEPS TO INITIALIZE A WEB SERVER
1. Make a new directory                                             `mkdir directory`
2. Index into this directory                                        `cd directory_name`
3. Create a new file called server.js                               `touch server.js`
4. Set up a new NPM package by following the commands following:    `npm init`
5. Open the project folder in Atom:                                 `atom directory_name`
6. Using NPM install the express module:                            `npm install express`
7. Require express in your server.js:                               `const express = require('express')`
8. Setup express:                                                   `const app = express();`
9. Create a root route get method with app.get():                   `app.get("/", function(req, res){ res.send("Hello, world!"); })`
10. Spin up our server on port 3000 with app.listen:                `app.listen(3000, function() { console.log("Server started on port 3000"); })`
11. Run server with nodemon                                         `npx nodemon server.js` OR `nodemon server.js` if it's globally installed

JavaScript:       A scripting language that enables functionality on websites.
jQuery:           A JS framework that makes JS easier
Node.js:          Enables JS outside the browser
Express.js:       A framework for Node, makes node easier
npm:              Node Package Manager
nodemon:          A module that dynamically restarts web servers so that we don't have to manually do it every time we update our source code.
bodyparser:       A module that allows us to parse the information we get from post requests

Now as you'd expect, you can also send entire HTML pages when browsers request
particular routes on your website, you aren't limited to only "Hello, world!".
That's what makes it a website after all.

Now, because any real website is going to be hosted on a remote server, instead of
writing out the filepath (of the HTML page you're going to send) relative to your
local machine, you start with `__dirname`. That gives you the file path of the
current file, regardless of where the file is hosted (your local copmuter or on
the cloud). For example, if you wanted to use "index.html" as your root route,
you'd use:

`app.get("/", function(req, res){
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
})`


POST REQUESTS
If your form has a "post" method, then it's sending some data somewhere. That
somewhere is defined by the "action" attribute. Generally you'll want to send
this data to your server, which in this case is at the home route location, so
just the forward slash `/`. You can see this in the form in the index.html file.
If you don't specify the action attribute location, it sends it to the page that the form
is on. Which in this case is the same thing, but we wrote out `/` for clarity.

We need to specify what happens when we get a post request (form submission) on
our website. We do that using the `app.post` function as shown in calculator.js.
But to tap into the data that is sent to our server, we have to use body-parser.
It's an npm module that allows us to parse the information we get from
post requests. To install we do: `npm install body-parser`. To use, we require
it and use it as specified in the calculator.js file.

body-parser has a few modes: "text", "json", "urlencoded". This is the output that it
parses the requests into. For example, if it's set to text, then it'll parse all
the requests into text. When we are trying to parse data that comes from an HTML
form, we use urlencoded. When we use the urlencoded output, we also have to
specify the `extended: true` option. This is so that we can parse nested requests.
We aren't doing that here, but body-parser requires that we specify it. All this
can bee seen in calculator.js.

Using body-parser allows us to use things like `req.body` which is the parsed
version of our HTTP request. We can console.log() this to see what it actually
returns. Remember, when we console.log() something it'll appear on terminal
running the server, not on our browser's console anymore.

Further, to tap into the actual data, we specify the name of the submitted
data field. Again, this can all be seen in calculator.js and index.html. In this
case we'd do: `req.body.num1`.

We'll learn more about all this with repetition, but for now, the important thing
to recognize is that the browser no longer gets to see our JavaScript code. Our
code is stored and delivered via the server, where the code can't be seen by the
client, and the calculations and actual programs are run and re-served outside
of the browser. The browser only gets to see the HTML & CSS that's rendered.
Actually it might also get some JS? Not sure, will have to learn more.


We also created another route: `/bmicalculator` that performs its own calculation
so that's another example to look at to understand routes and receiving post
data etc.
