HOW TO SOAK IN PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS
- Make sure you understand the fundamentals.
- Start out by building simple projects that you can complete fully. Build a skateboard and then turn it into a ferrari. Don't try and build a ferrari.
- Get good at Google, StackOverflow, Reddit, Quora, Youtube, etc.
- Just do more of it.
- Nothing new here. Just work harder and more consistently, like anything in life. Always hardest at first, but that's the exponential part, so the most valuable part.
- The more you struggle, the better you get.
- She wears the same stuff every day, she eats the same can of sardines every morning.
- Angela is a savage. A grinder.
- In other words, Angela gets it.


SCHEDULE FOR LEARNING TO CODE
- Make sure that you're optimizing learning creative tasks for when your brain is at its most productive state
- Try to get your diet to be low carb high protein
- She doesn't eat sugar. Refined, natural, anything. Says it's a drug. Had withdrawal symptoms for the first week but then broke through. Sounds kinda crazy. Look into this.
- If your brain is below 80% then maybe do more routine tasks like emails etc.
- If it's below 50% then go talk a walk or something.
- You also want to make sure that the projects you're working on have the appropriate balance of how competent you are at a task vs. how challenging the task is. Too challenging with low competency means anxiety. Not challenging enough with high competency means boredom.
- There are several resources out there to help you get repetition to practice problems and get better at coding and learn new concepts and technologies etc.
- One woman made a different website every day to get really good at making websites. Which makes sense.


HOW TO START FREELANCING
- Go slowly, strategically
- Try to carve out 15 hours a week to build a project that is useful to at least 1 person
- This stuff starts to become part of your portfolio
- Fiver is a good place to start. You don't make a lot of money here. You're just building up a reputation. Don't take on projects that will take you longer than a week. These things will be like bug fixes, etc.
- Then you can go to Upwork, etc.
- Communication is super important. Make sure they know ho wmuch work you're doing, and what the updates are.
- Cross-platform vs. Native: the obvious pros and cons to each side
