APIs

You know what these are. Ways for companies/websites to allow developers to
interact with their data/use their service in a particular way/link up their
data to an independent service/program that they're building. APIs generally have terms
and conditions on what is allowed and what isn't. You generally can't scrape
websites for their data, you'll have to use their API, with some exceptions.
They're sort of like contracts on what types of data is available and what
methods and protocols can be used to access them.

Official definition: Set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that
programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.

jQuery is an API.

We're mostly focused on reading data through an API from someone else's SERVER
to our server. That's the most powerful application of APIs.
