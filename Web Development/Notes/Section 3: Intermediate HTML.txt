<table> is beginning a table
<thead> is table head
<tbody> is the main body
<tr>    is table row

Using tables can be useful because it indents everything really well.

There are a bunch of different ways you can style and add padding to tables
through html but it's recommended to use CSS.

You can use form to collect data etc.
