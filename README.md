This is a collection of files that were compiled while taking Angela Yu's
Udemy Course on Full Stack Web Development.

Practice Sites 12 and 17 are nested Git repos, because they were deployed via
Heroku, which requires git logic for deployment. So they cannot be accessed via
the master folder. Thus, we've included them as independent repos on Github.  

Files Structure:
- Within Notes, we see a text file for each section of the course.
- We have several practice websites, some of which are live, some are not. Some, especially the earlier ones, are static files, some are server based applications.
- The below schedule links up the Practice Sites with where you can find my thought process creating them in the notes directory.
